calcWCD calculates weighted copublication distance between a gene/protein and a disease/term in PubMed literature.

## Installation

The released version of calcWCD can be installed from this repo directly:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ed-lau/calcWCD")
```

## Example

A basic example using test PMID and Annotation data included in the package: 
```{r example, warning=F, message=F}
require(calcWCD)
w <- wcd(pmids = test_pmids, annot = test_annotation)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}

hist(w$WCD, main="Distribution of WCD values.")

```
